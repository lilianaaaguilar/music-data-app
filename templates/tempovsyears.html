    <p>This chart shows the data within the music JSON file comparing the average tempo of all the songs listed with the years.</p>
    <p>This graph is meant to show if there was any correlation between songs tempos over the years.</p>
    <p>A chart like this could potentially answer the question of, "Has the tempo in most songs risen or fallen as years pass?"</p>
