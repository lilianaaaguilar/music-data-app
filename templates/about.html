    <p>The data used in this web app is from the CORGIS Dataset Project and can be found 
    <a href="https://corgis-edu.github.io/corgis/json/music/">here</a>.  The data contain statistics about music, the artists, 
    its attributes (tempo, key, mode, etc.), and popularity ("hotttnesss").
    </p>
    <p>
    The data includes songs from approximately 1978 to 2008. 
    Many entries are missing or incomplete with some songs having no year listed, 
    and many titles or release names are missing or appear as the number 0. 
    </p>
    <p>
    Each song, the dataset includes a lot of different measures that describe the musical characteristics and confidence levels in the data. 
    For example, confidence values such as key_confidence or mode_confidence represent how certain the analysis system 
    is about its predictions for musical key or mode. The mode value identifies whether the song is in a major or minor scale, 
    which can influence the mood the song sounds. Latitude and longitude values correspond to the artistâ€™s home location, 
    showing where the artist or group is based rather than where the song was recorded but even these values may sometimes be equal to 0.
